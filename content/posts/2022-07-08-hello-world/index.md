This is mainly a short post to see whether or not the infrastructure is working
as intended.

Withing this blog, we will probably see some languages used, I am not happy with
all of them, though this is the world we are living in ðŸ˜….

```nix,linenos
# nix
{ hello, runCommandNoCC }:
runCommandNoCC "hello-world" {} ''
  ${hello}/bin/hello > $out
''
```

```elixir,linenos
# elixir
defmodule HelloWorld do
  def hello, do: "Hello, World"
end
```

```erlang,linenos
%% erlang
-module(hello).
hello() -> "Hello, World".
```

```js,linenos
// javascript
function hello() {
  return "Hello, World";
}
```
