  12in23 has been announced on exercism.org and this are my initial thoughts
  on it!

import NoteBox from "../../../components/NoteBox.astro";

Yesterday I was greeted by a pop up on the [exercism] website, with a pop-up
that contained a text like the following:

> Hey everyone! Happy new year! For 2023, we've decided to do something a bit
> different and encourage everyone to try 12 different programming languages
> throughout the year! We're calling this The #12in23 Challenge. You should be
> seeing a new card on your dashboard to allow you to get started or go
> straight to [the information page][info] for more details and [my
> intro][12in23-vlog] video.

So I thought, lets plan ahead, and see what nice languages we have to try.

Just visiting the [track overview][tracks] and filtering it to only languages
that provide linux support gave me a list of 57 tracks remaining. Thats still
enough for one language per week, and I still would require that the earth takes
a bit longer to do its sun dance…

Though as I have already touched ~30 of those ~60 tracks I decided to narrow the
list down to languages that are really new to me (from exercisms point of view).

I will only do languages which I have not yet a single solution in.

This leaves me with the following opportunites:

1.  AWK
2.  Ballerina
3.  Common Lisp
4.  Delphi Pascal (why is this in "Linux"?)
5.  Fortran
6.  Groovy
7.  Kotlin
8.  MIPS Assembly
9.  Objective-C
10. Perl
11. Pharo
12. PL/SQL
13. PureScript
14. R
15. Raku
16. ReasonML
17. Red
18. Standard ML
19. Swift
20. Tcl
21. Unison
22. VB.Net
23. Vim script
24. WebAssembly
25. Wren
26. x86-64 Assembly

Among those I explicitely do not want to try

1. Delphi Pascal (as it is basically windows only)
2. MIPS Assembly (I had assembly during study, nothing I want to spent to much time with)
3. Objective-C (Isn't that Mac only?)
4. Swift (see Objective-C)
5. Unison (not a friend of this cloud only thing)
6. x86-64 Assembly (see MIPS Assembly)

So this leaves me with 20 languages to try…

As I do not want to have a though start right now, I will pick something that I
know that is available for NixOS to not have to do the nasty packaging at the
start.

Also it shall be something I am at least distantly familiar with, so I will try
out "Common Lisp" during January.

For the following 11 months, I will try a mix of randomness and manually filtering
the input/output of the randomness, to avoid far to heavy tasks for the travel
seasons or when there is a lot of work to do.

Also I might cancel individual tracks after the announcement of doing them, if
I realize that setting them up on NixOS is too cumbersome…

I will keep some notes about my progress here.
