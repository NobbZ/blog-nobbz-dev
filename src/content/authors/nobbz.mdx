Norbert is a software developer from Germany, whos primary language is [Elixir].

[Elixir]: https://elixir-lang.org/

His strong interest in Elixir began during his studies somewhen in 2014, when
he wanted to use a "functional alternative to [Ruby]" in a programming contest at
the university.

[Ruby]: https://www.ruby-lang.org/

When he wanted to test his contestant on the designated machine, he found out
that the erlang version installed did not support any released version of Elixir,
so he had to rewrite his contestant in [Erlang].

[Erlang]: https://www.erlang.org/

For a long time he used both languages in parallel, and became an Erlang track
maintainer at [Exercism] during 2015, where he still is. Within the same year
he also became a member and moderator of the [Elixir Forum], where he is still
active as well.

[Elixir Forum]: https://elixirforum.com/

In 2016 he started to work professionally to be able to pay for his university.
During that job he used mostly [Go] and [Python], though was able to use any
language necessary to get the job done.

[Go]: https://golang.org/
[Python]: https://www.python.org/

This did include [PHP], [Java], [C++], and [JavaScript] as well.

[PHP]: https://www.php.net/
[Java]: https://www.java.com/
[C++]: https://isocpp.org/
[JavaScript]: https://www.javascript.com/

In 2022 he finally was able to find a job where he was able to use Elixir
professionally, and is now working as a backend developer.

Besides of doing software development, he is also a passionate user of [NixOS].
He currently maintains a few packages in the official repository, and is
also using it on his 2 private machines. He also plays with [`nix`] on a virtual
machine on his work laptop (Apple).

For all the `nix` related things he is also active on the [NixOS Discourse] and
the inofficial [NixOS Discord].

Besides all his technical hobbies, he also is a father of 2 children.
