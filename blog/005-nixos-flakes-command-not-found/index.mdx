title: Flakes and "command-not-found"

  When you opted into nix-flakes to build your system, you usually realize
  quickly, that `command-not-found` does not work properly anymore and shows
  outdated or missing infos, alternatively it might show some weird errors
  about a sqlite file missing.

You might have realized already, that after you switched to flakes fully and removed all the channels,
you will see some errors about the missing file `/nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/root/channels/nixos/programs.sqlite`.

This is due to the command not found database being expected at a certain location tied to a default channel based
setup.

There are some ways to mitigate this, with more or less obvious downsides.

## Disable `command-not-found`

Simply disabling `command-not-found` might be the easiest solution to this problem, though results in
a quite obvious downside:

You won't find missing programs anymore.

If you still want to do it, it is as easy as:

```nix data-filename="configuration.nix"
programs.command-not-found.enable = false;
```

## Keep roots `nixos`-channel

Another solution is to simply keep a bitrotting `nixos` channel for root.

"Bitrotting" already implies, it will sooner or later run out of sync if (and you will) forget about it. You
can assume, that after 3 to 6 months you will hit siome occasion when you get displayed a package that
got removed, or you will see a message about an unknown program about which you are perfectly sure that
it should be known, as you use it in another terminal just fine via `nix shell`.

I will not go into details how to set up this variant and take it granted that everyone who would "keep" the
channel would know how to use them.

## Use the pre-generated database as input directly

In theory you can use the pregenerated database directly as a flake input and set it as the database URL then.

It would roughly look like this:

```nix data-filename="flake.nix"
inputs.programs-db.url = "https://channels.nixos.org/nixos-22.05/nixexprs.tar.xz";
```

```nix data-filename="configuration.nix"
programs.command-not-found.dbPath = "${inputs.programs-db}/programs.sqlite";
```

This has the big downside, that the everchanging hash of the tar-ball is persisted in the `flake.lock` and
will cause regular hash-mismatch when trying to build such a flake on a host that does not yet have the
tarball with the correct content hash on the disk.

## Use the `flake-programs-sqlite`-flake

There is a user who maintains a mapping from `nixpkgs`-commits to exact database URLs and their NAR-hashes.

Its set up is quite easy:

```nix data-filename="flake.nix"
programsdb.url = "github:wamserma/flake-programs-sqlite";
programsdb.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
```

```nix data-filename="configuration.nix"
programs.command-not-found.dbPath = inputs.programsdb.packages.${pkgs.system}.programs-sqlite;
```

The major downside is, you need to update this flake in conjunction with the flake you set to follow.

## Using `environment.etc` to improve the last 2 approaches

The last 2 approaches have the problem that they will only access the new database in a new shell, as the
location is hardcoded in the generated `command-not-found` script.

A way to easily mitigate is to use a redirection via `environment.etc`.

```nix data-filename="configuration.nix"
# Adjust the value for the nixexpr.tar.xz if necessary
environment.etc."programs.sqlite".source = inputs.programsdb.packages.${pkgs.system}.programs-sqlite;
programs.command-not-found.dbPath = "/etc/programs.sqlite";
```
